# ai-engineer-learning-path

This repository documents my journey through the AI Engineer learning path using Microsoft tools and services. It includes practical exercises, prompt engineering examples, Azure OpenAI explorations, and daily learning notes. The goal is to build hands-on experience with deploying, prompting, and evaluating AI models while applying real-world use cases.
