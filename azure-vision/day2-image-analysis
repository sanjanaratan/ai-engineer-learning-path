## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🏗️ 1. Azure Resource Setup
- Created a **Computer Vision resource** in Azure.
- Retrieved `KEY` and `ENDPOINT` from Azure Portal.
- Understood how to securely authenticate Azure SDKs using environment variables.

### 🧑‍💻 2. Cloning & Setting Up the Project
- Cloned [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision).

### 📷 3. Image Analysis Workflow
✅ Features Used
- Caption Generation: Produces a natural-language description.
- Dense Captions: Descriptions for multiple regions in the image.
- Tags: Assigns keyword tags (e.g., "car", "tree").
- Object Detection: Identifies and localizes multiple objects.
- People Detection: Detects human figures in the image.
